                        What's the difference?

                    <p>
                        <strong>Window Manager (WM)</strong> - A window manager offers the mere basics of managing
                        windows graphically. It allows for basic window manipulation, resizing, and deciding which
                        window is on top (focused window.) Examples include: <i>FVWM, IceWM, Fluxbox, Openbox, i3,
                            BSPwm, Dwm, AwesomeWM</i>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Tiling Window Manager (TWM)</strong> - A subset of the WM. Instead of dragging windows
                        around freely, TWMs prioritize "tiling" windows around the screen that does not overlap with
                        other windows. Examples include: <i>i3, BSPwm, Dwm, AwesomeWM, LeftWM</i>
                    </p>

                    <p>In addtion, many TWMs are Dynamic - meaning that the WM has preset modes that the user can switch
                        between in order to tile windows differently.</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Desktop Environment (DE)</strong> - A DE usually goes on top of a WM (e.g Plasma DE over
                        KWin WM). A DE adds many "clickable" and modern features, such as status bars, drag-and-drop,
                        and a bunch of preinstalled apps (e.g KDE Plasma install a lot of default KDE applications)

                    <p id="s1">
                        S Tier - Love to use!
                    </p>
                    <p id="s1">
                    <ul>
                        <li id="s1">i3 - The first TWM I never used. Configuration is pretty easy and intuivite.
                            Customization is also very powerful and extensible. IMO, i3 is a great TWM for both
                            beginners and power users.</li>
                        <li id="s1">LeftWM - Incredibly powerful and customization TWM. Default configuration is great
                            out-of-the-box. It also has great support for full customization with themes.</li>

                        <li id="s1">BSPwm - An innovative TWM that represents windows as the leaves of a binary tree.
                            Also very easy to customize, customization filesystem is intuitive and easy to get started
                            with.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p id="s2">A Tier - Use often but not a daily driver</p>
                    <li id="s2">QTile - Still a great TWM, but I find customization to be a little limited with its
                        Python-based config files.</li>
                    <li id="s2">Dwm - Default configuration is minimal (Dwm is written in C) and configuration is also
                        in C, so it's much harder to customize fully. However, I have seen some great builds with Dwm on
                        linux subreddits, so I'm fully confident Dwm has the power for customization and power use. I
                        just haven't "unlocked" its full potential.</li>


                    <p id="s3">B Tier - Rarely use, not bad though</p>
                    <li id="s3">AwesomeWM - I tried AwesomeWM for a few days and didn't <i>enjoy</i> it. I had no
                        problems with AwesomeWM fundamentally, I just found it difficult to configure to my liking.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li id="s1">Cinnamon - My current DE daily driver. It is lightweight and fast while not
                            sacrificing on an easy-to-use GUI configuration panel. The GUI itself offers a ton of
                            options for customization and productivity. Cinnamon is also extensible through
                            the use of Cinnamon Applets.</li>

                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p id="s2">A Tier - Use often but not a daily driver</p>
                    <li id="s2">Budgie - Feels like a cross between GNOME and Cinnamon. I don't have a lot of problems
                        with Budgie, I just feel that Cinnamon is a bit faster and snappier. However, Budgie has great
                        animations and smooth aesthetics.</li>
                    <li id="s2">GNOME - I never really not suited with GNOME's way of productivity. I know many people
                        that love GNOME's innovative and clean design, I'm just not one of them. I'll use GNOME when I
                        really need to focus on something, since I just feel the style/design of the DE helps me focus.
                        Furthermore, I've had some trouble with GNOME windows freezing up just by simply dragging them
                        (hardware is not an issue). The problem was resolved by adding a few lines to my GRUB config to
                        recognize my GPU upon boot</li>



                    <p id="s3">B Tier - Rarely use, not bad though</p>
                    <li id="s3">KDE Plasma - I also know a few people that enjoy Plasma's "Desktop Effects" and
                        "windows-like" design. I'm fine with it. Again, I just feel that Cinnamon is just a slightly
                        better alternative, being more lightweight and not installing a bunch of KDE apps for you.</li>
